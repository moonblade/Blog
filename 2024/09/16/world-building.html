<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Same world as ours, makes background work less daunting</li>
  <li>Hidden super world</li>
  <li>Mc thinks hes the only one for a while, before opening up into the wider super community
    <h3 id="ascension">Ascension</h3>
  </li>
  <li>Supers grow into their powers, when fully merged, they ascend to a different realm.</li>
  <li>General health benefits and longer living as they grow into their powers</li>
  <li>The ones in charge end up being people attached to worldly views but not the elite at power
    <ul>
      <li>at any point in time, there are some elites, above the people in charge in terms of raw power, but they are rarely interested in contesting since they have their own thing.
        <h3 id="being-super">Being super</h3>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Supers gain their powers, if they have latent abilities, when under duress, it doesn’t present immediately</li>
  <li>The threshold is much lower for the progeny of a super.</li>
  <li>It used to be much harder earlier, then a powerful super named xylion with nature powers appeared, he created the network, a mutation that spreads from tree to tree, uniting them into a singular network working together to increase the amount of mana in the ground, making it more abundant in the world, and increasing the number of supers that appear as a consequence.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="evolution">Evolution</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A super gains one power at the start, then depending on their potential, they might unlock related skills. A person who can turn invisible might learn later that they can also cast forcefields. Some of it is just not knowing what your power is. As it might be that you think you only have a subset of your powers. Theres no manual or instruction or floating window. So you have to experiment. Its like a new muscle, so it takes time to be good at it, and also to find uses for it and use it in new situations. When a power evolves, its usually due to the person trying to use it in a new way under heightened emotional state.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="plot-points">Plot points</h3>
<ul>

        <ul>
