> An interaction between two 79 year olds as witnessed by a 20 year old

---

You realise how soon the years have gone by, reminiscing the glory days of your college like they happened yesterday. Only when you factor in the year and count does it impress you how long it has been.

To be breathing in itself becomes a gift. To have been through a lot. The xp points are enough to trump any noobs. But xp unfortunately comes at the cost of HP and they would inevitably get scoffed. Experience it seems loses its value when you can't stand your ground.

Priority shifts on a lot of things. The littler things we take for granted brings a lot of joy. Religion gives them a lot to look forward to and it truly is bliss. Maybe the invention of lies were right. Maybe that was why religion started. To have hurt someone as this by saying no to belief and religion, an unpardonable sin. Family, family trees and the connection between obscure relatives brings joy. Reliving the past breathing life into it by remembering it again with an active participant. Unlike the sensitive noobs, people who can talk about death without batting an eye.

How pension evolved over the years and how mosques operated. Religion. Family. Glory days. Everything in a condensed capsule.

I feel i should say Thank you. Even though I shall forget this feeling of a mix of teary happiness and sadness, and go back to being me in an hour.
