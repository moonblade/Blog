> A long trip

---

### Mumbai 

Its boring here. I should prolly go on a trip. You know expand my horizons and stuff. Take a solo trip and see where it takes me. You know what, make it an extended trip, don't plan everything, plan a bit then see what happens. I might even end up liking it. The point is to gain the skill to be able to talk to random people. 

I bought a new bag coz the one I had can't really carry that much. Packed my bag, Booked a flight and got to mumbai. Have a friend in mumbai, figured I could stay at her place for a week and get her to introduce me to her friends, sort of like a training wheel before I full commit to solo travel to meet strangers.

I reached her place by ten pm and got immediately whisked to a game night at her friends place with like ten people I've never met. Well, hit the ground running I guess. Met the lot of them and played mafia and cards for a while with them. Had dinner there and came back by 1 am.

There was some fusili available, so figured might as well. and whipped up a serviceable pasta with the stuff available in pantry and some veggies.

We had that, took some photos for her insta, chatted for a while. Her friends came to meet her. Had already met them last time I was here. Chatted with them for a while.

Next day her roommate came, had met her as well last time, didn't really talk with her then. They went to office and I spent the day working from home. The next day, I figured a change of scenery was in order and went to a starbucks and worked there from noon to night. Went to another place and had the most amazing hot chocolate and a pasta and was near bursting by the end.

Went to juhu beach after playing hooky from work. Realized that coming to a tiny sandbox of a beach after being spoilt by the gorgeous calicut beach was a waste of time. https://photos.app.goo.gl/mXYGwP3wFw3GujxS6.

Friend told me about a cafe near the beach which apparently has a nice vibe/decor. So went in search of it. After a couple of false starts. Eventually found it. It had a nice ambience as advertised, but the food was pretty meh.

Friends friend had given her some meat cutlets to keep in fridge so that another friend could take it from her. Well, we ate it all. Muhahaha.

It was [raining](https://photos.app.goo.gl/JRsMHPkMNu9ZYs5a8) and I was bored and didn't want to work. So figured I'd go overboard and cook a full course meal. Roommate had said she wanted pasta the day before, so figured I'd make that. Also being a good samaritan I figured I'd replace the cutlets we stole and make new ones as well. Bought all the ingredients required. Saw some semolina, so ended up making a ton of kheer on top of the other stuff. Made cutlets first and then prepped everything for pasta.

Made pasta, kheer and cutlets. Roommate had gone out, so kept a note for her to eat the same. But later realized the treachery that she had eaten pizza before she came.

She apologised for being late and not eating pasta and took the pasta to her office the next day instead, and shared with her colleagues, all of whom sang high praise about it, mollifying me. Her friends had also come since it was the weekend and they had it as well, and loved it. This is my "I need to impress people" pasta. It's my signature dish at this point.

It's sunday, and I'm slated to go today. Her friends were trying to get her to date me since apparently I'm a catch. That does boost my self esteem. Friend was arguing that she was still just as cute as she was in college. I vehemently opposed it after seeing a college photo of her.

Left there and reached the airport and to my horror it looked like a crappy bus shelter instead of an airport. Imagine the airport gates being some desks you found in an alleyway kept in a row.
