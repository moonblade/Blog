Sometimes we makes promises to ourself, ideas that our dull witted minds come up with, that may improve our life. But the fact that we know that we won’t fulfil those promises, doesn’t seem to enter our minds, particularly during the turn of a new year.

Some people do try harder though, and its commendable how long they keep at it, despite knowing its a losing battle. For lasting changes, habits relying on your willpower aren’t the ones that should be targeted for change, but instead systems are. A system can be changed so that your way of thinking about, or going about a particular action changes, which results in a tiny (note that it has to be tiny, it can’t be so huge, that it inevitably relies on willpower as well) change, that can be reproduced consistently.

As an example, instead of tracking your to read books in google keeps, to using goodreads. Although losing the ability to track where you get the recommendation from, you gain the ability to track, set progress, and complete items and even receive recommendations in a much more organised way. This might result in you reading more.

But be sure that your goals, while lofty, are for the purposes of yourself and not for the others around you, since that causes you to meet the goals, despite your personal feelings about the matter. It might rob you of the pleasure of working towards your ideal. Beware of propping up your “image” resulting in you straining your back while getting nothing in return except a broken will.
