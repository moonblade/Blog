Eli was driving his way back along the interstate, on his way home from another tough day at work. He worked in an architecture firm in LA. He had known he wanted to be an architect since high school and gotten into one of the best colleges in the country, landing an internship in the firm and had been converted to full time once done. Most days he loved his job, it was a dream come true and most clients were receptive to his vision and were agreeable. A couple of his current clients were extremely nit-picky though, having him redesign over and over for the most inane reasons, or so he thought. The work was still fun though. Unfortunately his boss had dumped another client on him, and any arguments on his part of the current client projects taking priority not having any effect. Oh well, he'd see how the new client was, hopefully they were more agreeable. He kept getting worked up over work, his thoughts going in a spiral. He wanted to reset his mood before he got home, He fiddled around with the radio hoping to listen to something good. To his elation, one of his favourite songs was playing. 

Nodding along to the song, he turned into the off ramp. He was starting to forget work and get into weekend mood. He was pulling into his neighbourhood when his phone started buzzing. "Hey shorty", he said answering the call figuring it was probably Jesse. Driving with one hand on the phone was probably not the best. But hey, he it was the suburbs and he was going slow enough, right. 
"Hey soup, I got it!!". 
He could hear the excitement clear in her voice. 
"The last round was a bit dicey. But they liked the presentation enough and green-lit the project". 
"Congrats shorty. That's great. Now you get to be your own boss right.". 
"Well..... kinda, I still have to submit updates every week. But mostly ya. And I get to boss around a couple of interns as well. It'll be fun.". 
He was turning a corner when he noticed an old homeless man pushing a cart along the sidewalk. 
"Listen, I'm almost home, victory dinner at my place?"
He found his eyes being inextricably pulled towards the man. Making eye contact, the old man smirked at him and mouthed a word. 

**CRASH**

”What was that? Eli?….. Eli?”

He lay on a stretcher, the hum of the vehicle surrounding him like a fog. Voices echoed, muffled as he tried to piece together what had happened. The harsh lights and sounds of what he guessed was an ambulance not doing any favours for his nausea. ”What happened” he asked in a weak voice, trying to sit up. “Sir, you have a concussion. Please lie back down”, the EMT said, his voice steady. “It looks like you were in a pretty bad crash. Your car was upside down when we found you.” He flashed a reassuring smile. “You were extremely lucky, though; you seem to have gotten off with nothing more than a concussion. Still it’s best to confirm at the ER”. He tried to fall back to unconsciousness but the EMT was having none of it, “Sir, I need you to stay awake for me.”

“You were in a serious accident, luckily, no fractures or bleeding. Just some bruises and a mild head injury” The doctor said in a calm practised tone. “Your brain took a hit. You’ll probably feel nauseas, dizzy, and have a headache for a few days. But these should clear up on their own. Take it easy for a few days - no heavy lifting, intense concentration and no screen time if you can help it. Have someone check in on you every few hours at least for the next day or two”. The doctor paused, and added “Rest is important, but you should try to stay awake for a few more hours. We’ll monitor your symptoms and if everything looks good, we’ll get you discharged. How does that sound?”. Before I could answer, the door burst open and a short redhead was looking around frantically in the ER. Jesse finally saw me, and her face went from frantic to relieved in a couple of seconds. “What the hell happened. I was beside myself with worry. They wouldn’t tell me anything, just that you were in a crash.” The doctor was giving Jesse the stink eye, interfering with his patient didn’t win her any points. But he sighed and walked away. 

“Hey… Hey…. Look at me. Breath….. It’s all right. I’m all right. Just a concussion. See, I’m all right.” reassuring Jesse, Eli sat up and made room for her to sit on his bed. “What happened, soup?”. Hearing the stupid nickname, he knew she was calmer. “That’s the thing, I don’t know. I got distracted by something on the sidewalk. But I was going slow, I was pushing thirty at most, and there was nothing to hit. I was in the middle of the road.” “I’ve told you time and again not to answer the phone when you’re in the car. Why don’t you ever listen”. Eli tried to find a comeback, but the nausea and  headache clouded his thoughts. . He lay back down exhaling slowly. “I don’t know. Maybe I wanted to hear your voice.“ He managed a tired smile. “But I still maintain that it wasn’t the phone that caused the accident. We’ll know for sure tomorrow when I go get my car”. “When I go get your car you mean. You aren’t going anywhere mister.” She countered, her tone softening as she reached out, fingers lightly brushing his. “I’m really glad you’re okay”, she murmured leaning in, before he knew it, he was kissing her. Her eyes widened slightly, a blush creeping up her ears “Uhh.. ya I’m glad” she said looking away and he couldn’t help the grin that spread across his face.
