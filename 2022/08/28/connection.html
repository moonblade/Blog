  <p>Observations from a fly on the wall</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>Humans say a lot of stuff, and do something else, what a person is to an outside observer could be summed up as their actions. But to ourselves, each action has a trail of reasons, circustances, and exceptions trailing behind it. 
Muddling through our day to day life, our actions sing a duet called interaction, changing us in subtle ways too slow to notice. Over the course of time, we are molded without our ever realizing it. 
A lot of us look back on the process, wondering at the twists and turns, Some few look upon it in the present, finding an upcoming fork. A rare few have what it takes to turn into a path, even fewer to turn away.</p>

<p>Still, most of us are able to rest a while, look at the way we’ve come, and marvel that we made it this far. Think about the significant figures that affected our paths, the ones we spent the most time with, or the ones that touched us most.
The figures that play such a pivotal role could be total strangers, though more often than not, they are closer to home than that. The more you have interacted with a person, the higher the chance that they have already shifted your path. 
The more force someone can exert on you, the more they may be able to shift you, or the more they may steady you when you drift. This tangible force, this connection, is a hard fought reward. 
We might not notice it, but it takes a lot of investment to have it. We might have invested in dribs and drabs over the course of years, but it compounds to something deep rooted and steady.</p>

<p>Interactions when observed in any particular instant of time will never reveal the immense history of interactions that built this connection.
Experiences of love, loss, temper and tranquility that over time built, not a perfect connection but a deep one. 
But the more you observe, the more you catch a glimpse, out of the corner of your eye, of the vastness of the underlying connection, and you can’t help but be awestruck by it.</p>

<hr />

<p>Some rare few times, connections could spring up instantly and last for the rest of time. 
At others, connections once thought to be rock solid, might erode over time and distance till it is a mere shadow of its former self.
All told, they help us navigate this maze of life and treat it as if it were a path with a destination and that we had a plan all along.</p>

<p>Connections strengthen and weaken, build anew or fade away, throughout the course of our path, and like actors in a play, 
we watch and mouth our lines, never stepping foot outside our intended roles, never hoping for more than we have.</p>

<p>Well, heres to breaking our shackles and aiming higher. To abrupt lousy endings and better connections.</p>
